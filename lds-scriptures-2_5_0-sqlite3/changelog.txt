Mormon Documentation Project - LDS Scriptures
---------------------------------------------

2.5.0
-----

- First custom XML release.

- Added Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP (.xls) and OpenDocument Spreadsheet
(.ods) formats to the export list

- PostgreSQL:
	* used smallint instead of int where possible
	* encoding set to LATIN1
	* cleaner database dump
	* changed all fields to NOT NULL

- MySQL:
	* Removed all NULL values

- SQLite:
	* All NULL values changed to blank

- CSV:
	* Removed the newlines in the CSV files on lds_scriptures_books,
	which may have caused some problems when someone is trying to
	split up the rows based on \n or \r.

- Added 'pilcrow' field to lds_scriptures_verses: Now instead of
verse_scripture having &#142;, the exports have a boolean flag so whoever
uses the data can decide if they want to display the pilcrow or not.
Affected 2,964 verses (all in the Old and New Testaments).

- Text exports (CSV, XML, TeX, ODS, XLS) now have files for both the
relational tables AND a non-relational file (lds_scriptures).  Basically,
it means that all the data from all the tables is in one file in addition
to the regular export of each table individually.  The old releases
would usually have one or the other.  If you're interested in creating
a non-relational table for the databases, see the 'Notes' section on
the website.  Exporting an additional table would increase the export
size greatly, so they are not included in the database downloads.

- Fixed verses where two spaces were between two unpunctuated words.
See the section 'Errata' in the documentation for details about the
punctuation and spacing in the scriptures.

Affected 75 verses:

Num. 6:20, Deut. 5:15, Deut. 31:17, Judg. 16:17, Isa. 37:21, Jer. 34:12,

3 Ne. 11:38, 3 Ne. 13:16, 3 Ne. 17:18, 3 Ne. 19:20, 3 Ne. 23:13, 3
Ne. 26:17, Morm. 9:36, Ether 3:16, Ether 8:11, Ether 9:31

- Fixed verses that still had verse numbers in the beginning of the text.

Affected 133 verses:

- Cleaned up the documentation.

- Fixed the newlines on the documents in the .zip exports.

2.4.0
-----
- Fixed the files in .zip packages so they use DOS file formats.
The documents and exports should be viewable in Notepad now.

- Fixed the broken XML .zip export (v2.3.0 wouldn't unzip)

- Added lds_org to lds_scriptures_volumes and lds_scriptures_books,
stores the naming scheme for the directories used on the Church's
Scriptures website.  See http://scriptures.lds.org/

- Added num_books, num_chapters, num_verses to lds_scriptures_volumes

- Added num_chapters, num_verses to lds_scriptures_books

- Cleaned up the installation documentation for MySQL + Windows

2.3.0
-----
- New standardized book and verse titles, based on Church's "Abbreviations
and Designations in Footnotes and Index".  The new standardization fixes
a large number of questions as to how the books should be referenced in
book_title and book_title_short, what the verse_title value for the Four
Gospels would be (St John, St. John, Saint John, John), and fixes old
values in lds_scriptures_books (ex: 1 Chronicles).  Thanks to everyone
who made me aware of the issues. :)

- MySQL: Added a FULLTEXT index on lds_scriptures_verses.verse_scripture.

See the MySQL documentation on how this can really help when writing
functions to search the database.
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Fulltext_Search.html

- Fixed bug where 62 verses from New Testament were missing.

- Fixed bug where verse_title and verse_title_long were incorrect in
lds_scriptures_verses

- Much needed documenation finally created in DocBook format.
http://mdp.nephi.org/scriptures/docs/

- lds_scriptures_books: book_title, book_title_long for Articles of
Faith and Doctrine and Covenants fixed

- lds_scriptures_books: dropped volume_order, book_chapters, book_verses

- Simplified field names

	lds_scriptures_volumes
	----------------------
	volume_name -> volume_title
	volume_name_long -> volume_title_long

	lds_scriptures_verses
	---------------------
	verse_chapter -> chapter
	verse_number -> verse

- Databases: Optimized varchar lengths and field types

- Databases: Added a "unique" index on lds_scriptures_verses verse_title
and verse_title_short.

- Fixed a duplicate entry of chapter, verse, verse_title,
verse_title_short for 3 John 1:1

- Fixed over 300 instances of double spaces between words (not sentences)
in verse_scripture.  I found a bug where there were two spaces between
words in sentences and they didn't belong.

For instance, "Abel was a keeper of sheep."

2.2.0
-----
- Moved the Book of Mormon to volume_id 3 instead of volume_id 1, so
that the order of the books is more like the actual printed versions.
Also makes it simple if someone only wants the KJV Bible, they only need
to delete the rows where volume_id > 2.
	new id name

	1 Old Testament
	2 New Testament
	3 Book of Mormon
	4 Doctrine and Covenants
	5 Pearl of Great Price

  The change affected all three tables.

- PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite:

	Added new indexes on lds_scriptures_verses:
	verse_id
	volume_book_chapter_verse
	book_chapter_verse
	verse_title
	verse_title_short

- Dropped book_id 88 (History of the Church) from lds_scriptures_books

- MySQL: "scriptures" table renamed to lds_scriptures, and recreated
with less fields, and reindexed.

2.1.0
-----
- MySQL: Generated a new non-relational table that contains
all the data: "scriptures" for creating XML, TeX and CSV formats.

	CREATE TABLE scriptures SELECT mdp_scriptures_verses.verse_id,
	mdp_scriptures_verses.volume_id,
	mdp_scriptures_volumes.volume_name,
	mdp_scriptures_volumes.volume_name_long,
	mdp_scriptures_volumes.volume_subtitle,
	mdp_scriptures_verses.book_id, mdp_scriptures_books.book_title,
	mdp_scriptures_books.book_title_long,
	mdp_scriptures_books.book_title_short,
	mdp_scriptures_books.book_title_jst,
	mdp_scriptures_books.book_subtitle,
	mdp_scriptures_books.book_chapters,
	mdp_scriptures_books.book_verses,
	mdp_scriptures_verses.verse_chapter,
	mdp_scriptures_verses.verse_number,
	mdp_scriptures_verses.verse_scripture,
	mdp_scriptures_verses.verse_title,
	mdp_scriptures_verses.verse_title_short FROM
	mdp_scriptures_books, mdp_scriptures_verses,
	mdp_scriptures_volumes WHERE mdp_scriptures_verses.book_id =
	mdp_scriptures_books.book_id AND mdp_scriptures_verses.volume_id
	= mdp_scriptures_volumes.volume_id;


- XML, CSV and TeX: The exports use the non-relational table now, so
all the data is in one file.

- Converted HTML entries to plain text or removed them:

	Old New Example
	&#151; -- Doctrine and Covenants 1:9
	&#8212; -- 1 Nephi 1:13
	&#147; " Doctrine and Covenants 135:4
	&#148; " Doctrine and Covenants 135:4


  The Pilcrow (&#182; - see Genesis 1:6) was *not* removed from any of
  the scriptures.  I can't seem to reach a decision whether to take
  them out or leave them in myself (since the printed version of the
  LDS Scriptures contains them, but some terminals may not render them
  correctly), so I am leaving it up to the user.  If you want to remove
  them that's up to you. :) I would recommend taking them out for the
  XML or CSV formats of the Scriptures though.	If you are using them in
  anything other than an HTML displayed page, you probably don't want to
  see them.  Note that the KJV module for Sword does _not_ include them.

- Dropped Bible Dictionary and History of the Church from volumes table
since they are empty.

- Renamed mdp_scriptures and tables to lds_scriptures

- Fixed a bug in New Testament where any book that started with 2 or 3
(2nd Thessalonians) the verse_number of the first verse was set to 0
instead of 1.  (Thanks, Byron!)

2.0.2
-----
- Fixed 3 scriptures where &#145 (a quote "'") wasn't replaced:
	Exodus 9:29
	Psalms 24:1
	Isaiah 44:5

	MySQL:

	  UPDATE mdp_scriptures_verses SET verse_scripture =
	  REPLACE(verse_scripture, "&#145;", "\'");

	PostgreSQL:

	  UPDATE mdp_scriptures_verses SET verse_scripture =
	  REPLACE(verse_scripture, '&#145;', '\'');

	SQLite:

	  UPDATE mdp_scriptures_verses SET verse_scripture = "And Moses
	  said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will
	  spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall
	  cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest
	  know how that the earth is the LORD's." WHERE verse_id = 8376;
	  UPDATE mdp_scriptures_verses SET verse_scripture = "THE earth
	  is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
	  that dwell therein." WHERE verse_id = 20847;
	  UPDATE mdp_scriptures_verses SET verse_scripture = "One shall
	  say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the
	  name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto
	  the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel." WHERE
	  verse_id = 25143;

2.0.1
-----
- Removed all instances of mdp_scriptures_chapters

- Forgot to mention (in this ChangeLog) a difference from the original
text in the Scriptures -- I omitted the * in Joseph Smith-History 1:71.
Also,
I should note that Oliver Cowdery's events are not included, since they
don't really fall in "standard" scripture format.  Whether they should be
included or not, I dunno.  Maybe in Revision 4.

2.0.0
-----
- General reindexing, renaming, and cleaning of database tables

Revision 1.3
------------

2004-04-27

* mdp_scriptures_books

	Inserted the values for books_verses

	Updated book_title, book_title_long, book_title_short and
	book_subtitle
	for all the books in the Pearl of Great Price to correspond to the
	printed version of the LDS scriptures

	Tweaked the database indexes

	Updated book_title_long to = book_title if book_title_long
	was NULL

* mdp_scriptures_volumes

	Added volume_name_long and volume_subtitle

* mdp_scriptures_verses

	Replaced instances of &amp;#182; with &#182;

2004-04-19

* mdp_scriptures_verses

	Fixed the verse_title for the Four Gospels.  John => St John

	Fixed the paragraphs (&#182;) not showing up in the Gospels and
	The Acts

2004-04-18

* mdp_scriptures_verses

	Because of a bug in my original importing script, any chapter
	with over
	one hundred verses was being ignored.  The 119th psalm was the
	only one
	affected, and has been added.

	The Book of Amos was added, which was left out.

	The Song of Solomon was added, which was left out.

	Column 'book_id' was renamed to 'volume_book'

Revision 1.2
------------

2004-03-31

* mdp_scriptures_verses: Since revision 1.1 included going back to
	a more original import to redo the export and clear out all the
	listings, I forgot, again, to pull out the 'comprising' chapter
	headers
	which remained in these verses:

	Mosiah 8:21
	Mosiah 22:16
	Alma 4:20
	Alma 6:8
	Alma 8:32
	Alma 16:21
	Alma 35:16
	Alma 37:47 (not a 'comprising chapters' header)
	Alma 38:15
	Alma 44:24
	Helaman 6:41
	Helaman 12:26
	3 Nephi 10:19

	And even though revision 1.0 listed Alma 21 as containing a
	header, I didn't
	see it in this revision, so either I was wrong the first time,
	or I got it
	out this time and didn't document it.  Either way, Alma 21 *does*
	have a
	comprising chapter header, but it is not in the database in
	Alma 20:30.

	Also, removed "THE END" from Moroni 10:34

Revision 1.1
------------

2004-03-27

* mdp_books: renamed to mdp_scriptures_books

* mdp_scriptures: renamed to mdp_scriptures_verses

* mdp_volumes: renamed to mdp_scriptures_volumes

* mdp_scriptures_verses:
	- Deleted duplicate rows
	- Reindexed the primary key
	- Added indexes on volume, book, chapter and verse
	- Fixed incorrect 'title' values
	- Added title_short column (1 Ne. 1:1)
	- Reorganized rows so they are all in the correct order
	- Deleted <small> tag from 'scripture'

	- Added 'book' column
	- Deleted 'Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith', 'The Testimony
	of the
	Eight Witnesses', 'The Testimony of the Three Witnesses' and
	'Title Page'
	since they are not 'books' in the sense of having scriptures.
	Will add
	back in Revision 2 with mdp_scriptures_extras, including the
	King James
	Version Biblical dedication
	- Added all the title_long values for the Bible
	- Renamed the 'title' values to the book title seen on the pages
	of the LDS
	KJV Bible (originally was the values on the Table of Contents)

	scriptures.lds.org)
	- Added 'title_short' column

	Price, instead
	of including it as a separate volume of work (may change in
