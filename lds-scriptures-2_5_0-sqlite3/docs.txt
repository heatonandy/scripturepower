Chapter 1. Introduction

1.1. About

   The goal of the lds-scriptures project is to provide database
   and text exports of the canon of scriptures as published by
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

   The project is part of a larger one, called the Mormon
   Documentation Project (or MDP for short) which is a group of
   projects meant to gather, document, index, archive, and make
   accessible works in the public domain that have been published
   by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and
   release those texts and tools back into public domain.

Chapter 2. The Scriptures

2.1. The Printed Word and Imported Text

   In converting the Scriptures from one format to another, there
   has been a few instances where I would have to decide how to
   format or include certain parts of the printed text.

   The differences between the printed word and the imported text
   can be categorized in three areas: ommitted text, formatting
   styles and naming standards.

   While some changes are necessary, it's worth noting that the
   actual text of the scriptures have themselves been unchanged,
   and in fact, every effort has been made to standardize
   everything based on the formatting and style of the printed
   works.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2. Omitted Texts

   The main reasons for excluding text from these packages are
   generally either copyrights, or it isn't feasible or justified
   to put them in database format. However, they may be included
   in future versions.

   Study Guides

   In the LDS Scriptures, a lot of study guides have been added
   to the text to help readers. Since they are copyrighted, they
   are not included.

   These are the study guides that were left out: book and
   chapter headers, footnotes, Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary,
   Joseph Smith Translation, Gazetteer, Maps, Pronunciation Guide
   and Index (Book of Mormon).

   Title Pages, Dedications and Explanations

   Even though the Church's official scriptures website includes
   them, these packages don't because they a scriptural numbering
   sequence doesn't apply.

   Excluded texts:

   Book of Mormon: Title Page (written by Moroni), Introduction,
   The Testimony of the Three Witnesses, The Testimony of Eight
   Witnesses, Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and A Brief
   Explanation About the Book of Mormon.

   Doctrine and Covenants: Official Declaration 1 and 2.

2.3. Formatting Styles

   The Changelog is the best place to see the details of the
   changes.

   The Pilcrow

   The Pilcrow is seen throughout all the books of the Old
   Testament, in the Four Gospels, and in The Acts. Before
   v2.5.0, the pilcrow was stored as its HTML display value
   (&#182;) in the verse_scripture field. As of v2.5.0, it has
   been changed to a boolean field value.

   Capitalization

   In all the standard works, the first word in the first verse
   in each chapter is capitalized. The imported text is no
   different.

   Regarding the capitilazation of "LORD" and "GOD" in the Bible,
   the Bible Dictionary explains. "In the KJV, the Jewish custom
   has been followed, and the name is generally denoted by Lord
   or God, printed in small capitals."

   One of the original exports actually had every instance
   enclosed in <small> tags, but they were removed, since there
   is no real universal way to tag them (XML aside).

   Dashes

   A lot of scriptures have double dashes in them, and though
   there is an HTML character you can use to display them, they
   were replaced with two dashes instead to keep the mix between
   text and formatting minimal.

   Volume Order

   In previous releases, the Book of Mormon was the first volume
   listed, and was also the first volume in the other tables as
   well.

   Since v2.2.0, the Old and New Testaments took the lead
   instead, following the same order used in the printed works.
     _________________________________________________________

2.4. Naming Standards

   When referencing the scriptures, one verse can have many
   titles. Do you use John 3:16, St. John 3:16, Saint John 3:16
   or St John 3:16?

   While you may have your own preference, these packages
   standardize on a format that the Church has provided in their
   standard works. I call it the ADFI, and it's used in all their
   footnotes and scripturual references.

   Abbreviations and Designations in Footnotes and Index

   If you look at the front of your Book of Mormon you'll see a
   page with that title. Instead of trying to dream up a naming
   scheme, the project uses the same as the standard works. So in
   the case of our example, the verse would be referenced as
   "John 3:16" in the indexes and footnotes.

   In the rest of the documenation, I refer to this reference as
   the ADFI.

Chapter 3. The Database

   Volumes, Chapters, Books and Verses

   This chapter outlines the table structure of the databases.
     _________________________________________________________

3.1. lds_scriptures_volumes

   This table provides the text of the volumes.

   Table Structure

   volume_id
          The primary key

   volume_title
          Volume titles from the ADFI.

   volume_title_long
          "The" prepended to volume_title

   volume_subtitle
          Appended to volume_title_long, could be used as a
          formal title.

   lds_org
          The directory structure that the Church uses on their
          Scriptures website.

   num_books
          Number of books in the volume.

   num_chapters
          Number of chapters in the volume.

   num_verses
          Number of verses in the volume.
     _________________________________________________________

3.2. lds_scriptures_books

   When accessing this table, the fields you will probably be
   most interested in using are: volume_id, book_title and
   book_title_short. The other fields are included for
   documentation and reference.

   Except for one field in the table, volume_id, all the fields
   are references which the table lds_scriptures_verses relates
   to.

   Table Structure

   book_id
          The primary key

   volume_id
          The relational field to
          lds_scriptures_volumes.volume_id.

          For example, the volume_id of Hebrews is 2. The
          volume_title of volume_id 2 is New Testament.
          Therefore, the book of Hebrews is in the New Testament.

   book_title
          The book titles from the ADFI.

          In some previous releases, it used to be the book
          titles that were used as the page headers for
          references, but those are not always the same (ex:
          "Articles of Faith" in ADFI, "The Articles of Faith" in
          header. [2]).

          Examples: Genesis, Exodus, Matthew, Mark, 1 Nephi, 2
          Nephi, Doctrine and Covenants, Articles of Faith

   book_title_long
          The (sometimes) extended title printed at the beginning
          of the book of scriptures.

          Not every book has an extended title. For those that
          don't, the field value is the same as book_title.

          Examples: The First Book of Moses called Genesis, The
          Second Book of Moses called Exodus, The Gospel
          According to St Matthew, The Gospel According to St
          Mark, The First Book of Nephi, The Second Book of
          Nephi, The Doctrine and Covenants, The Articles of
          Faith

   book_title_short
          The book abbreviations from the ADFI.

          Examples: Gen., Ex., Matt., Mark, 1 Ne., 2 Ne., D&C, A
          of F

   book_title_jst
          The Joseph Smith Translation [3] of book_title_long.

          Every field is null except the entries for the Four
          Gospels, where "The Gospel According to" is replaced
          with "The Testimony of".

          These are the only JST references included in the
          database.

   book_subtitle
          Subtitles appended to book_title_long.

   lds_org
          The directory structure that the Church uses on their
          Scriptures website.

   num_chapters
          Number of chapters in the book.

   num_verses
          Number of verses in the book.
     _________________________________________________________

3.3. lds_scriptures_verses

   Table Structure

   verse_id
          The primary key

   volume_id
          The relational key to lds_scriptures_volumes.volume_id

   book_id
          The relational key to lds_scriptures_books.book_id

   chapter
          The chapter number in the book

          Example: For Helaman 3:29, the field value is "3"

   verse
          The verse number in the chapter

          Example: For Helaman 3:29, the field value is "29"

   pilcrow
          Boolean value of whether scripture text starts with a
          pilcrow.

          HTML equivalent of &#142;

          Added in v2.5.0.

   verse_scripture
          The text of the scripture.

          "Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the
          word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall
          divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the
          wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a
          strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf
          of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked--"

   verse_title
          The value for lds_scriptures_books.book_title, chapter
          and verse.

          Example: For Helaman 3:29, the field value is "Helaman
          3:29"

          Both this field and verse_title_short are redundant in
          a relational database, but they do come in handy.

   verse_title_short
          The value for lds_scriptures_books.book_title_short,
          chapter and verse.

          Example: For Helaman 3:29, the field value is "Hel.
          3:29"
